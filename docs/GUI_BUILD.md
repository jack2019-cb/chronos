   - [x] Implement view switching logic in CalendarArea
   - [x] Add live preview panel to CalendarArea
   - [x] Set up smart defaults (current year, clean theme, holidays)
   - [x] Connect view switcher to update calendar view
   - [x] Add placeholder data for events and holidays

   Current Focus:

   - Year View optimization and refinement
   - Theme system implementation
   - Performance improvements

   Next Steps:

   - Month View implementation
   - Event handling system
   - Drag and drop functionality

   To Consider:

   - **State management** architecture choice
   - Performance optimization for view transitions
   - Caching strategy for calendar data
   - Interface consistency across views
   - Real-time preview performance implications

3. **Customization Tools**

   - Theme and color palette selection UI
   - Font and background customization controls

   To Consider:

   - Theme system architecture (CSS variables vs styled-components)
   - Performance impact of dynamic styling
   - Asset management for fonts and backgrounds
   - Preview optimization strategies

4. **Creative Tools**

   - Stickers, icons, and decorations panel
   - Notes and photo attachment support

   To Consider:

   - Asset loading and optimization
   - Storage strategy for user uploads
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - Performance with multiple decorative elements

5. **Event Management**

   - Drag-and-drop event creation/editing
   - Event categories and color-coding
   - Recurring event UI

   To Consider:

   - Event data structure design
   - Conflict resolution for overlapping events
   - Performance with many events
   - Mobile touch interactions

6. **Export & Sharing**

   - PDF/image export options
   - Shareable link generation

   To Consider:

   - Export queue management
   - Background processing for large calendars
   - Security considerations for sharing
   - Rate limiting and resource usage

7. **Accessibility & Responsiveness**

   - Keyboard navigation
   - Responsive layout for desktop/tablet/mobile

   To Consider:

   - ARIA roles and labels
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Touch target sizes
   - Responsive image strategies

## Development Priorities

1. Current Phase:

   - Year View refinement and optimization
   - Theme system completion
   - Performance monitoring and improvements

2. Next Phase:

   - Month View implementation
   - Event management system
   - Drag and drop functionality

3. Future Phases:
   - Week View implementation
   - Day View implementation
   - Advanced features (export, sharing, etc.)

> Note: Development is currently focused on perfecting the Year View as the primary calendar interface. Other views (Month, Week, Day) are planned but not yet implemented. This approach ensures a solid foundation and optimal performance before expanding functionality.

> This list will be updated as features are completed or reprioritized. Each major task can be broken down into subtasks as implementation proceeds.
