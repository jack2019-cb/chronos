# GUI Build

## Major Tasks for Current Implementation

1. **Scaffold New GUI Components** âœ“

   - [x] Create new CalendarCreatorPlus component file
   - [x] Set up sidebar component (Sidebar.tsx)
   - [x] Set up top bar component (TopBar.tsx)
   - [x] Set up main calendar area component (CalendarArea.tsx)
   - [x] Integrate sidebar, top bar, and main area in CalendarCreatorPlus
   - [x] Add placeholder content for each section
   - [x] Ensure basic layout is responsive
   - [x] Create and integrate CalendarCreatorPlus.module.css for layout

   To Consider:

   - Component composition patterns for reusability
   - Prop drilling vs Context API for state management
   - Testing strategy for component integration
   - Accessibility patterns from the start

2. **Implement Core Features**

   - [ ] Add view switcher UI to TopBar (year/month/week/day)
   - [ ] Implement view switching logic in CalendarArea
   - [ ] Add live preview panel to CalendarArea
   - [ ] Set up smart defaults (current year, clean theme, holidays)
   - [ ] Connect view switcher to update calendar view
   - [ ] Add placeholder data for events and holidays

   To Consider:

   - State management architecture choice
   - Performance optimization for view transitions
   - Caching strategy for calendar data
   - Interface consistency across views
   - Real-time preview performance implications

3. **Customization Tools**

   - Theme and color palette selection UI
   - Font and background customization controls

   To Consider:

   - Theme system architecture (CSS variables vs styled-components)
   - Performance impact of dynamic styling
   - Asset management for fonts and backgrounds
   - Preview optimization strategies

4. **Creative Tools**

   - Stickers, icons, and decorations panel
   - Notes and photo attachment support

   To Consider:

   - Asset loading and optimization
   - Storage strategy for user uploads
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - Performance with multiple decorative elements

5. **Event Management**

   - Drag-and-drop event creation/editing
   - Event categories and color-coding
   - Recurring event UI

   To Consider:

   - Event data structure design
   - Conflict resolution for overlapping events
   - Performance with many events
   - Mobile touch interactions

6. **Export & Sharing**

   - PDF/image export options
   - Shareable link generation

   To Consider:

   - Export queue management
   - Background processing for large calendars
   - Security considerations for sharing
   - Rate limiting and resource usage

7. **Accessibility & Responsiveness**

   - Keyboard navigation
   - Responsive layout for desktop/tablet/mobile

   To Consider:

   - ARIA roles and labels
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Touch target sizes
   - Responsive image strategies
