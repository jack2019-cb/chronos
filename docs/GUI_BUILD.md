     - [x] Responsive design: adapts for desktop/tablet/mobile
     - [x] Accessibility: keyboard navigation, ARIA labels

   **Wireframe Description:**

   - The customization sidebar contains three main sections:
     1. ThemeSelector: shows color swatches or theme previews in a grid/list
     2. FontSelector: displays font names with sample text or style
     3. BackgroundSelector: shows image thumbnails or color blocks
   - Selecting an option updates the calendar preview instantly.
   - The sidebar is always visible on desktop; collapsible on mobile/tablet.
   - All controls are accessible via keyboard and screen reader.
   - [x] Scaffold new components:
     - ThemeSelector
     - FontSelector
     - BackgroundSelector
   - [x] Integrate customization components with Context API for state management
   - [x] Add live preview functionality to CalendarArea for customizations
   - [x] Document theme system and customization logic in technical docs

   To Consider:

   - Theme system architecture (CSS variables vs styled-components)
   - Performance impact of dynamic styling
   - Asset management for fonts and backgrounds
   - Preview optimization strategies

4. **Creative Tools**

   - Stickers, icons, and decorations panel
   - Notes and photo attachment support

   To Consider:

   - Asset loading and optimization
   - Storage strategy for user uploads
   - Undo/redo functionality
   - Performance with multiple decorative elements

5. **Event Management**

   - Drag-and-drop event creation/editing
   - Event categories and color-coding
   - Recurring event UI

   To Consider:

   - Event data structure design
   - Conflict resolution for overlapping events
   - Performance with many events
   - Mobile touch interactions

6. **Export & Sharing**

   - PDF/image export options
   - Shareable link generation

   To Consider:

   - Export queue management
   - Background processing for large calendars
   - Security considerations for sharing
   - Rate limiting and resource usage

7. **Accessibility & Responsiveness**

   - Keyboard navigation
   - Responsive layout for desktop/tablet/mobile

   To Consider:

   - ARIA roles and labels
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Touch target sizes
   - Responsive image strategies
