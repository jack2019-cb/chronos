## Frontend Bootstrapping Tasks

### 1. Initialize Next.js app with TypeScript in `client/`

- Set up a new Next.js project in the `client/` directory using TypeScript.
- Ensure the app runs with `npm run dev`.
- Commit the initial project structure.

### 2. Add Tailwind CSS or styled-components for styling

- Choose and install either Tailwind CSS or styled-components.
- Integrate the chosen styling solution into the Next.js app.
- Add a sample styled component or page to verify setup.

### 3. Set up ESLint, Prettier, Jest, and React Testing Library

- Configure ESLint for code linting (use dev container config if available).
- Add Prettier for code formatting.
- Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration tests.
- Add a sample test to verify the setup.

### 4. Use environment variables for API endpoints and keys

- Create a `.env.local` file in `client/` for local development environment variables. **Do not commit this file.**
- Document required environment variables in `client/README.md`.
- Update code to use environment variables for API endpoints and keys.
- **Note:** For production and CI/CD, all secrets and sensitive configuration must be managed using GitHub Secrets only. See the root `README.md` section "Secrets & Sensitive Data" and "Environment Variables & .env Usage" for policy and details.
