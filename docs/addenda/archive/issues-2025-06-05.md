# ChronosCraft AI Issues Log

## [2025-05-28] HTTP ERROR 502 on Frontend - FIXED

- **Description:** When accessing the frontend (e.g., via Codespaces URL), a 502 Bad Gateway error was shown.
- **Root Cause:** Missing CORS configuration in the backend server and improper API URL configuration in the frontend.
- **Solution:**
  - Added CORS support to Express backend (`cors` package)
  - Created `.env.local` in frontend with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` configuration
  - Ensured proper port forwarding in devcontainer.json
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Fixed Date:** 2025-05-28

- **Description:** ~~When attempting to select multiple months in the calendar creation interface, only January remains selected regardless of other month selections.~~
- **Resolution:** Issue has been fixed in commit beba227. Changes include:
  - Ensuring at least one month is always selected
  - Maintaining months in chronological order
  - Properly handling month toggle state with TypeScript safety
- **Status:** Resolved

## [2025-05-28] Server Module Resolution Issue - FIXED

- **Description:** Server startup issue with module resolution for www file

  - Aligned `module` and `moduleResolution` settings for proper TypeScript configuration
  - Verified server startup with proper route initialization
- **Status:** Fixed
- **Fixed Date:** 2025-05-28

## [2025-05-31] Database Authentication Issues - RESOLVED

### Description

Test execution was failing due to database authentication errors with invalid credentials.

### Root Cause

Environment variables mismatch between application and database service configuration.

### Solution Steps

1. Aligned environment variables with `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` recommendations:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://vscode:password@db:5432/chronocraft
   POSTGRES_DB=chronocraft
   POSTGRES_USER=vscode
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
   ```
2. Updated docker-compose.yml to use matching fallback values
3. Cleaned existing volumes for fresh database initialization
4. Re-ran migrations and regenerated Prisma client

### Verification

- All 24 tests passing across 3 test suites
- Project save/load functionality working correctly
- Database container health check passing
- Test coverage at 87.8% for project routes

### Prevention

- Follow environment variable guidelines in `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`
- Don't set `DATABASE_URL` in `server/.env` unless specifically needed
- Rely on devcontainer-managed environment variables
- Always verify credential consistency between app and database service

### Status

- Fixed and verified on May 31, 2025

## [2025-05-31] Database Authentication Issues - RECURRING

### Description

Previously resolved database authentication issues have resurfaced. The solution implemented earlier today is no longer working. This was due to a mismatch between the environment variables and the persistent database volume. The final solution is to always use environment variables and reset the database volume if credentials change.

### Status

- See [2025-06-01] entry above for final resolution and reset instructions.

## [2025-06-01] Database Authentication Issues - ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

### Description

Root cause of the recurring database authentication issues from May 31 has been identified.

### Root Cause Analysis

The database health check script (`scripts/devcontainer_db_health_check.sh`) was using incorrect credentials:

- Using: trainCov/ChronosCraftAIfork
- Should be: vscode/chronocraft (as per May 31 fix)

This mismatch caused the health check to potentially mask authentication issues and led to inconsistent database state.

### Solution

1. Updated health check script to use correct credentials
2. Aligned with the working configuration from May 31:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://vscode:password@db:5432/chronocraft
   POSTGRES_DB=chronocraft
   POSTGRES_USER=vscode
   POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
   ```

### Next Steps

1. Verify health check now passes with correct credentials
2. Re-run the full test suite to confirm resolution
3. Update documentation to reflect correct credentials

### Status

- Root cause identified and fixed on June 1, 2025
- Awaiting verification

## [2025-06-01] Database Authentication Issues - ACTUAL CONFIGURATION IDENTIFIED

### Description

Investigation of the database authentication issues has revealed that our previous "fix" was incorrect. The actual database configuration differs from what we thought.

### Current Configuration

Actual environment variables in use:

```env
POSTGRES_USER=trainCov
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=adVenti
POSTGRES_DB=ChronosCraftAIfork
```

### Root Cause Analysis

This section is obsolete. See the final resolution below: all database credentials must be provided via environment variables, and a database reset is required if credentials change. No hardcoded or default credentials are used anywhere in the system.

### Required Actions

1. Either:
   - Update all services to use the actual credentials (trainCov/ChronosCraftAIfork), or
   - Reconfigure the database container to use the intended credentials (vscode/chronocraft)
2. Ensure docker-compose.yml, .env files, and all configuration documents are aligned
3. Update documentation to reflect the correct credentials

### Next Steps

1. Review docker-compose.yml configuration
2. Check all .env files for credential references
3. Update `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` with correct values
4. Re-verify database connectivity with consistent credentials

### Status

- OPEN (Pending Decision)
- Need to decide which credential set to standardize on

## [2025-06-01] Database Authentication Issues - FINAL RESOLUTION

### Description

All database authentication and health check issues have been resolved. The system now relies strictly on environment variables for all database credentials, ensuring secrets are not hardcoded and configuration is secure.

### Key Points

- The health check script and all services require `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB` to be set in the environment before startup.
- No fallback or default values are used for secrets in code or configuration files.
- The database container will only initialize with the credentials present at first startup. If the persistent volume is not reset, changing environment variables will NOT change the database credentials.

### When and Why a Database Reset is Necessary

If you change any of the database credentials (user, password, or database name), you must also reset the persistent database volume. This is because PostgreSQL only uses the environment variables to initialize the database on first run. After that, the credentials are stored in the database files on disk (in the Docker volume). If you change the environment variables but do not reset the volume, authentication will fail.

**To reset the database:**

```zsh
docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml down -v
./scripts/devcontainer_db_health_check.sh
```

This will remove the old database and create a new one with the credentials you have set in your environment.

### Status

- All scripts and configuration now require explicit environment variable setup.
- The health check script will fail fast and clearly if any required variable is missing.
- The process is now robust, secure, and fully documented.

## [2025-06-01] Database Credential Management and Health Checks - COMPLETED

- **Description:** Implemented secure database credential management and health check procedures
- **Changes Made:**
  1. Removed all hardcoded database credentials from documentation
  2. Updated configuration guide with secure credential management practices
  3. Added detailed database health check documentation
  4. Verified environment variable usage in all scripts
- **Technical Notes:**
  - All database credentials must be set via environment variables
  - Health check script available at `scripts/devcontainer_db_health_check.sh`
  - If database credentials are changed, the persistent volume must be reset:
    ```bash
    # Stop containers and remove volume
    docker compose -f .devcontainer/docker-compose.yml down -v
    # Start fresh with new credentials
    ./scripts/devcontainer_db_health_check.sh
    ```
- **Status:** Completed
- **Completed Date:** 2025-06-01
