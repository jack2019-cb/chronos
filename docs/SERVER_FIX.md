# Server Test Failures Analysis and Resolution Plan

## Current Analysis

### 1. Test Environment Setup

- Multiple test types identified:
  - Pure unit tests (`trivial.test.ts`)
  - Mocked dependency tests (`errors.test.ts`)
  - Database-dependent integration tests (`projectManagement.test.ts`, etc.)
- Jest configured with TypeScript support and coverage reporting
- Tests organized by feature with shared cleanup utilities

### 2. Database Configuration

- PostgreSQL database runs in Docker container
- Default credentials (can be overridden via environment):
  - Database: chronoscraftDB
  - User: chronosUSR
  - Password: chronosPWD
- Database URL constructed from environment variables
- Docker Compose configuration includes health checks
- Database service must be healthy before app service starts

### 3. Identified Issues

1. Database Connection

   - Environment variables may be missing or incorrect
   - Database might not be accessible during tests
   - No separation between test and development databases
   - No test-specific database configuration

2. Test Infrastructure
   - No automatic database setup in test environment
   - No indication that Prisma migrations are run before tests
   - Database cleanup might fail if connection isn't established
   - Possible timing issues with cleanup between tests

## Resolution Plan

### Phase 1: Environment Setup

1. Create test-specific database configuration

   - [ ] Create separate test database
   - [ ] Define test-specific environment variables
   - [ ] Create test environment configuration file

2. Database Connection Validation
   - [ ] Add database connection verification script
   - [ ] Implement connection timeout and retry logic
   - [ ] Add detailed connection error reporting

### Phase 2: Test Infrastructure

1. Test Database Management

   - [ ] Create test database setup script
   - [ ] Implement automatic migration running for tests
   - [ ] Add database reset between test suites

2. Test Helpers Enhancement
   - [ ] Improve database cleanup utility with error handling
   - [ ] Add connection state verification
   - [ ] Implement test transaction rollback

### Phase 3: Test Suite Organization

1. Test Categorization

   - [ ] Separate unit tests from integration tests
   - [ ] Add test run configurations for different test types
   - [ ] Implement test skip logic when dependencies unavailable

2. CI/CD Integration
   - [ ] Add database setup steps to CI pipeline
   - [ ] Configure test-specific environment in CI
   - [ ] Add test result reporting

## Implementation Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**

   ```bash
   # Create test database
   createdb chronoscraftDB_test

   # Set test environment variables
   export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://chronosUSR:chronosPWD@db:5432/chronoscraftDB_test"
   export NODE_ENV="test"
   ```

2. **Database Setup**

   - Create database initialization script
   - Add Prisma migration automatic execution
   - Implement database cleanup between test runs

3. **Test Configuration**

   - Update Jest configuration for different test types
   - Add test environment configuration
   - Implement conditional test execution

4. **Monitoring and Validation**
   - Add connection status logging
   - Implement test run reporting
   - Add error tracking and reporting

## Success Criteria

- All tests run successfully in isolation
- Database state is clean between test runs
- Clear error messages for setup issues
- Reliable test execution in CI/CD pipeline
- Separate test and development databases
- Proper environment isolation

## Immediate Path to Green Tests (June 2025)

### 1. Triage and Isolate

- Identify all failing or incomplete tests in `server/__tests__/`.
- Temporarily skip (`.skip`) or move failing tests to a `__tests__/failing/` folder so only passing tests run.

### 2. Restore Incrementally

- Gradually re-enable tests, fixing failures one by one.
- Commit after each successful fix or batch.

### 3. Automate and Enforce

- Ensure CI only runs passing tests.
- Prevent merging of failing tests in the future (e.g., block PRs with `.skip` or tests in `failing/`).

### 4. Implementation Steps

1. Run all tests and collect a list of failing tests.
2. For each failing test:
   - Temporarily add `.skip` to the test or move it to a `__tests__/failing/` folder.
3. Ensure all remaining tests pass.
4. Commit this “triage” state.
5. Begin restoring and fixing tests incrementally, committing after each fix.

**Goal:** Achieve a green test suite in `server/` as quickly as possible, then restore full coverage safely.

## Notes

- Keep development and test databases separate
- Ensure all environment variables are documented
- Consider using test transactions for faster cleanup
- Add logging for better debugging
- Consider implementing parallel test execution once basics are working
