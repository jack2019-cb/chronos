# Consultant Contribution Workflow

This document describes the simple workflow for contributing to the Chronos project as an external consultant, after direct access to the main repository is no longer available.

## Steps for Contributing

1. **Fork the Public Repository**

   - Go to the Chronos public repository on GitHub.
   - Click the "Fork" button to create your own copy of the repository under your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork**

   - On your consultant machine, clone your forked repository:
     ```sh
     git clone git@github.com:your-username/chronos.git
     ```

3. **Make Changes**

   - Implement your changes in your forked repository as needed.
   - Commit your changes with clear, descriptive messages.

4. **Push Changes to Your Fork**

   - Push your commits to your fork on GitHub:
     ```sh
     git push origin main  # or the relevant branch
     ```

5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**

   - Go to your fork on GitHub.
   - Click "Compare & pull request" to open a PR from your fork to the main Chronos repository.
   - Add a description of your changes and submit the PR.

6. **Review and Approval**
   - The project owners will review your PR.
   - If approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository.
   - If changes are requested, update your fork and PR as needed.

## Notes

- This workflow keeps things simple and secure.
- No need to manage multiple SSH keys or complex configurations.
- All contributions are tracked and reviewed via GitHubâ€™s standard PR process.

**This is the recommended process for all future consultant contributions.**
