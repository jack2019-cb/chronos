## Current Status (2025-06-04)

### Active Branch: feature/calendar-api

- Location: `/workspaces/caramel`
- Last Completed: Prisma schema setup, initial database configuration
- Currently Working: Documentation updates and CI/CD planning
- Next Action: Database integration implementation

### Key Files Modified

- `/server/prisma/schema.prisma` - New database schema
- `/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` - Updated CI/CD documentation
- `/.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Current CI configuration
- `/docs/CONFIGURATION.md` - Updated environment configuration

### Ready to Work On

1. Database Integration:

   - Schema created at `/server/prisma/schema.prisma`
   - Next: Run initial migration
   - Then: Implement database operations in calendar API

2. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - Current file: `/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
   - Required changes documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`
   - Focus on Playwright integration first

## Recent Progress (as of 2025-05-27)

- Cleaned up and standardized the `client/` directory structure for Next.js best practices
- Added a sample smoke test to `client/__tests__/` to verify frontend test setup
- Successfully fixed all frontend test failures (5 tests across 3 suites now passing)
- Removed Babel configuration in favor of SWC transformation
- Added proper Next.js mocks in `jest.setup.ts`
- Updated Next.js configuration for proper test environment
- Created comprehensive documentation of Babel removal in `BABEL_REMOVAL.md`
- All backend and frontend tests are now passing
- The development environment is managed by a dev container with pre-installed tools
- Completed calendar API CRUD operations with TypeScript
- Achieved 100% test coverage for calendar API endpoints
- Added comprehensive error handling for calendar API

## Immediate Priority

### CI/CD Enhancements

As documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`, the following CI/CD improvements are needed:

- [ ] Add Playwright integration tests to CI pipeline
- [ ] Implement production build verification steps
- [ ] Add automated linting checks to CI workflow
- [ ] Set up code coverage reporting and tracking
- [ ] Create deployment workflows for staging/production environments

### Frontend (client/)

- [ ] Begin implementing core calendar creation UI (select year/month, event input, etc.)
- [ ] Set up API integration with backend endpoints (e.g., `/calendar`)
- [ ] Start building GenAI prompt UI and output preview
- [ ] Verify frontend UI accessibility in Codespaces environment

### Backend (server/)

- Database Integration (PostgreSQL with Prisma):

  - [✓] Create Prisma schema (`/server/prisma/schema.prisma`)
  - [ ] Initialize database and run first migration
  - [ ] Update calendar routes to use Prisma Client
  - [ ] Add error handling for database operations
  - [ ] Write database integration tests

- Calendar API Implementation:

  - [✓] Define proper data models for calendar events
  - [✓] Implement CRUD operations for events
  - [ ] Add PDF export endpoint (`/server/routes/calendar.ts`)
  - [ ] Integrate with external calendar services
  - [ ] Add project save/load functionality
  - [ ] Implement GenAI integration for themes

- [✓] Complete TypeScript migration for calendar API
- [ ] Implement authentication and user/project persistence

### General

- Keep documentation up to date as features are added
- Review and update MVP checklist and roadmap as milestones are reached
- Ensure all code passes linting and tests before merging to `dev`
- Note: The dev container ensures a consistent environment for all contributors, so onboarding and setup are simplified. Focus on configuration and feature development rather than tool installation.

## Immediate Technical Debt Sprint (2025-05-28)

- Migrate all backend JavaScript files to TypeScript
- Review and expand test coverage for backend and frontend
- Audit and update documentation for all APIs and modules
- Document progress and completion in CHANGELOG.md and issues.md

## Branch Integration (2025-06-04)

### Pre-Merge Requirements

- [ ] Complete database integration with Prisma
- [ ] Finish calendar API implementation
- [ ] Complete documentation updates from Technical Debt Sprint

### Merge Process

1. Update and verify test coverage:
   - [ ] Backend Jest tests
   - [ ] Frontend Jest tests
   - [ ] Integration tests
2. Prepare merge:
   - [ ] Create temporary merge branch from dev
   - [ ] Test merge in temporary branch
   - [ ] Verify database migrations
3. Final merge:
   - [ ] Merge feature/calendar-api into dev
   - [ ] Verify deployment configuration
   - [ ] Update deployment documentation
