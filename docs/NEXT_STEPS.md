- [ ] Start building GenAI prompt UI and output preview
- [ ] Verify frontend UI accessibility in Codespaces environment

### Backend (server/)

- Database Integration (PostgreSQL with Prisma):

  - [✓] Create Prisma schema (`/server/prisma/schema.prisma`)
  - [✓] Initialize database and run first migration
  - [✓] Update calendar routes to use Prisma Client
  - [✓] Add error handling for database operations
  - [✓] Write database integration tests

- Calendar API Implementation:

  - [✓] Define proper data models for calendar events
  - [✓] Implement CRUD operations for events
  - [✓] Add PDF export endpoint (`/server/routes/calendar.ts`)
  - [✓] Google Calendar Integration (Phase 1 - Mock Implementation):

    1. Create service layer for calendar integration:
       - [✓] Set up `services/googleCalendar.ts` with interface
       - [✓] Implement mock data provider
       - [✓] Add integration tests with mock data
    2. Add new endpoints:
       - [✓] GET `/calendar/google/auth` (mock OAuth flow)
       - [✓] GET `/calendar/google/callback` (mock token handling)
       - [✓] GET `/calendar/google/events` (return mock events)
       - [✓] POST `/calendar/google/import` (simulate import)
    3. Error handling:
       - [✓] Add specific error types for calendar integration
       - [✓] Implement proper error responses
    4. Testing:
       - [✓] Unit tests for service layer
       - [✓] Integration tests for endpoints
       - [✓] Error handling tests
    5. Documentation:
       - [✓] Update API documentation
       - [✓] Add integration guide

  - [ ] Google Calendar Integration (Phase 2 - Production): [Moved to V0.2]

    1. Setup Requirements:
       - [ ] Create Google Cloud Project
       - [ ] Enable Calendar API
       - [ ] Configure OAuth 2.0 credentials
       - [ ] Set up OAuth consent screen
    2. Implementation:
       - [ ] Real OAuth flow integration
       - [ ] Token storage and refresh handling
       - [ ] Real Calendar API integration
       - [ ] Rate limiting and quota management
    3. Security:
       - [ ] Secure credential storage
       - [ ] Token encryption
       - [ ] Access scope management

  - [ ] Add project save/load functionality
  - [ ] Implement GenAI integration for themes
  - [ ] Improve test coverage:
    - [✓] Cover error handling in `lib/errors.ts` (improved from 60% to 100%)
    - [✓] Improve Google Calendar Integration coverage (achieved 97.77%)
    - [✓] Improve Project Management API coverage (improved from ~25% to 90.9%)
      - [✓] Add route tests (all endpoints covered)
      - [✓] Add service layer tests (statements: 90.9%, functions: 85.71%)
      - [✓] Cover CRUD operations and error handling
      - [✓] Add validation edge cases
      - [✓] Address settings object edge cases
    - [✓] Improve Google Calendar Integration coverage (current: 97.77%)
      - [✓] Add error condition tests
      - [✓] Improve request validation coverage
      - [✓] Test mock implementation edge cases

## Current Test Coverage Status

Overall backend coverage: 88.67% (up from 87.35%)

- Statements: 88.67%
- Branches: 75.58%
- Functions: 91.18%
- Lines: 88.67%

- [✓] Complete TypeScript migration for calendar API
- [ ] Implement authentication and user/project persistence

### General

- Keep documentation up to date as features are added
- Review and update MVP checklist and roadmap as milestones are reached
- Ensure all code passes linting and tests before merging to `dev`
- Note: The dev container ensures a consistent environment for all contributors, so onboarding and setup are simplified. Focus on configuration and feature development rather than tool installation.

## Immediate Technical Debt Sprint (2025-05-28)

- Migrate all backend JavaScript files to TypeScript
- Review and expand test coverage for backend and frontend
- Audit and update documentation for all APIs and modules
- Document progress and completion in CHANGELOG.md and issues.md

## Branch Integration (2025-06-04)

### Pre-Merge Requirements

- [✓] Complete database integration with Prisma
- [ ] Finish calendar API implementation
- [ ] Complete documentation updates from Technical Debt Sprint

### Merge Process

1. Update and verify test coverage:
   - [ ] Backend Jest tests
   - [ ] Frontend Jest tests
   - [ ] Integration tests
2. Prepare merge:
   - [ ] Create temporary merge branch from dev
   - [ ] Test merge in temporary branch
   - [ ] Verify database migrations
3. Final merge:
   - [ ] Merge feature/calendar-api into dev
   - [ ] Verify deployment configuration
   - [ ] Update deployment documentation
