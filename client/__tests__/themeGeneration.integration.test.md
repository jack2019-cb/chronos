# themeGeneration.integration.test.md

## Test Purpose

This integration test validates the business logic of theme generation, ensuring that themes are created and applied correctly based on user input and AI suggestions.

## Mocking Philosophy

Mocks are used only for external dependencies, such as AI API calls. Internal logic, including theme application and user interaction, is tested directly without superficial or excessive mocking.

## Actionables

- Simulates user input for theme generation.
- Validates correct theme creation and application.
- Mocks AI API responses only, not internal theme logic.

## User Experience Flow

- Validates natural conversation flow with AI.
- Verifies meaningful AI suggestions based on user input.
- Tests refinement of suggestions through feedback.
- Ensures AI remains in co-pilot role, not driver.
- Supports "AI as Co-Pilot" principle through interaction testing.

## Performance Expectations

- AI response processing within 200ms.
- Theme application within 50ms.
- Smooth transition animations (60fps).
- Memory footprint under 15MB.
- Supports "Simplicity & Flow" principle.

## Hallmarks

- Tests real substance: theme generation and application.
- Isolates only true external dependencies (AI APIs).
- Runs quickly and deterministically.
