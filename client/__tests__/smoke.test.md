# smoke.test.md

## Test Purpose

This unit test serves as a basic smoke test to confirm that the test environment and setup are functioning correctly.

## Mocking Philosophy

No mocks are used, as the test does not interact with external dependencies. It simply verifies that the testing framework is operational.

## Actionables

- Runs a basic assertion to confirm the test suite is working.

## Hallmarks

- Tests real substance: the integrity of the test environment.
- No external dependencies to isolate.
- Runs quickly and deterministically.
