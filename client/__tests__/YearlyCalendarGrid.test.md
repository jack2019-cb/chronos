# YearlyCalendarGrid.test.md

## Test Purpose

This unit test validates the real business logic of the `YearlyCalendarGrid` component, ensuring that selected months and events are rendered correctly.

## Mocking Philosophy

Mocks are used only for external dependencies (e.g., network calls if present). Internal logic, such as event handling and month selection, is tested directly without superficial or excessive mocking.

## Actionables

- Renders the grid for selected months and events.
- Confirms correct display of event titles and dates.
- Avoids mocking internal state or rendering logic.

## Visual Impact

- Validates consistent spacing and alignment of calendar grid
- Verifies responsive behavior at different viewport sizes
- Ensures proper font scaling and readability
- Checks proper theme application to calendar elements
- Aligns with "Aesthetics First" principle by validating visual hierarchy

## Performance Expectations

- Grid rendering completes within 100ms
- Month switching animation runs at 60fps
- Event hovering responds within 16ms
- Memory usage remains under 10MB during tests
- Supports "Simplicity & Flow" principle through performance validation

## Hallmarks

- Tests real substance: calendar rendering and event logic.
- Isolates only true external dependencies (none in this test).
- Runs quickly and deterministically.
